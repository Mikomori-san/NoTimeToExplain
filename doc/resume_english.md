# Project Summary

## Project Name: No Time To Explain

"No Time To Explain" is a game developed for MMP1. Below, you will find a summary of the key features and outcomes of the project, as well as the challenges and learning experiences that followed:

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Create a finished game with completion conditions (highscore, death).
- **Duration**: Approximately 1 month.
- **Team Members**: Kevin Raffetseder

## Technologies and Tools

- C#
- Dotnet 7.0
- SFML.Net
- Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code
- Photoshop (for assets)

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenges**: Turn-Based Movement, Level & Room Administration, Pathfinding (A* or BFS).
- **Solutions**: Singleton TurnHandler & RoomHandler classes, Algorithm: Customized Breadth-First Search.

## Achieved Goals

- Expansion of existing programming knowledge.
- Enhanced understanding of abstractions in "larger" projects.
- Practical application of a self-implemented pathfinding algorithm.
- Acquisition of new programming techniques and styles.

## Avoidable Mistakes for Future Projects

- Abstraction from the start.
- Each class has its specific purpose.
- Use flags instead of numerous booleans.
- Code organization for better readability.
- Consistently write comments from the beginning.
- Avoid magic numbers from the outset.

## Conclusion

There were some ups and downs during the project, but overall, it provided valuable programming experience. For instance, I now think more about abstractions that could have improved the project. Also, having comments on existing code while programming is a significant help as it can remind you of certain processes or what specific code snippets do.
I now place a strong emphasis on code readability, as it not only benefits other devs but also provides better clarity of the code for me. It offers only advantages.
I look forward to future projects and applying my newly acquired knowledge!
